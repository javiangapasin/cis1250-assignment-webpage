  <h1>Writing Assignment 1</h1>
  <p>The software development process is the process of planning, designing, and implementing software. The point of this process is to try and develop the best solution possible to a client’s problem. It’s made up of 5 main steps. Gathering requirements about the problem, such as a timeframe or certain aspects that must be included. It focuses on WHAT the problem is. Next is designing a plan to build the software. This step requires problem solving skills, careful planning and ultimately requires the most time and effort. Doing this step well will speed up the rest of the process. This focuses on HOW the problem is solved. After this comes the implementation process, where the actual programming is done and the software is built. Next is the verification process, where test cases are run to ensure that the software is actually meeting the requirements that were gathered in the first stage, and ensuring that the software is working properly. Most importantly, this checks to make sure that the software does what the client was asking for, and makes sure that the problem is being solved the way that the client wants. Finally, after all of these steps, is maintenance. This step requires making sure the software continues to run well, checking in with the client to see if it is still performing okay, and maybe even updating the software so that it runs more optimally. 
</p>
  <p>Software design is important because it’s extremely beneficial to have software that is easy to use, but also solves whatever problem the software was designed for. You can’t just solve a problem right away and build a good piece of software like that. The process is important, and therefore the way that the software is designed is also important.</p>
  <p>For example, I use a piece of software called Notion. It helps me stay organized, so I know what needs to be done. I think it’s well designed for a few reasons. First and foremost the interface is extremely user friendly. It’s black and white, with a nice font, and it’s very easy to navigate with all its labels. The actions that you can perform are very straightforward, as it tells you what each button can do. There’s also a lot of flexibility in the actions you can perform and the things you can do, from calendars to lists. It’s also cross platform, and free to use!</p>

  <p>During the requirements gathering stage, you are trying to find out what exactly the problem is and what exactly the client wants the software to do. Requirements are a set of operations the software must perform, and therefore we need this stage so we can get a very clear description of what the client needs. The first part of this stage after being approached by a client with an idea is finding out what needs they have, and separating them from the wants that the client has. This is done through asking LOTS of questions and conversing with the client. You should brainstorm questions with your team so you can get specific answers from the client. After this, you’ll actually write the requirements in a document using the following template: The user/system type must/should do one thing. This template will help you identify specific things that the client NEEDS in the software, and specific actions that must be included. There should be emphasis on the “one thing”, as having too many things will be too hard to solve. The key to gathering requirements is communication. Effectively communicating with the client, and listening to them is critical. </p>

  <h2> <u>User Stories for Notion</u> </h2>
    <p>As a student, I want to create a to-do list so that I can keep track of my tasks. I have a lot going on as a student, so a digital to-do list would help me keep track of what I need to do, while within the application.</p>
  <p>As a student, I want to create a calendar so that I can keep track of due dates. I have many courses as a student, so it’s important for me to be able to know when things are coming up. </p>
  <p>
As a computer scientist, I want to be able to create a teamspace to be able to share notes and ideas with my team. Teamwork is very important in my job so I think it’s critical where we have a space to organize our ideas.
</p>
  <p>As a teacher, I want to be able to implement my learning plan in a table. This is so I can keep track of what’s been taught, as well as any important things that are still outstanding, along with assessments that may be coming up.</p>
  <p>
As a senior leader on my team, I want to be able to create an agenda so I can keep my team updated on tasks that are completed, need to be completed, and will be completed in the future.

  <p> The elements of empathy consist of emotion, culture, and context. Emotion relates to empathy because emotion is what we feel. Feelings of joy, or sadness is something we all feel. Empathy is related to this because to show empathy, we have to understand the emotions of others. Culture relates to the social behaviors of different groups of people. Culture differentiates based on where you are or where you’re from, but understanding the culture surrounding a person or people can help you really understand the human being(s). Context relates to the reason why things are important to us. For example a necklace that has an important story and meaning behind it. Context is important in understanding why certain things have meaning. 
</p>
  <p> The three business models are “sheep”, “homo economicus”, and “tasks and goals”. The sheep model is concerned with persuading customers, even if that means lying about a product and its capabilities. This model completely disrespects the customer, who’s trying to help the organization. It disregards emotion and does not care about the customer or their feelings, as long as the product is bought. The homo economicus model believes that humans are rational and our decisions are carefully calculated in order to maximize utility (or amount of satisfaction). This model does not take into account things like context as the reason we make decisions, and assumes we are purely analytical. The tasks and goals model views humans as beings that know exactly what they’re trying to do and have an exact plan to accomplish a goal. The problem is we’re essentially viewed as robots. This model lacks emotion and context too, as it ignores why we pursue these tasks and goals. They could make us feel emotion, or there could be a meaning behind us pursuing these goals. </p>

The product I’m going to be talking about is Apple’s iPod. The iPod was a revolutionary portable digital audio device, that differentiated from CD players and other MP3 players. The iPod was a much smaller device, with basic functions that were to browse media, play media, rate media, and change the volume level. This may not sound like much, but the part that really stood out was Apple’s focus on the user experience. Apple’s idea was beyond those basic functions, and their real goal was giving the user full control of their media. What media they wanted, when they wanted to play it, and where, was all behind Apple’s true vision for the iPod. The true design excellence was in the system that encapsulated the user’s experience with the iPod, and it’s a three part system. Acquiring media through CD’s, files or through Apple’s iTunes Music store. Managing media through Apple’s iTunes software, which allows you to browse through your media, delete it, make playlists, or rename items. Finally, we get to the iPod device itself which allows you to put it all together and play the media you want, wherever you want, and whenever you want. All three of these components blended together exceptionally to create an amazing user experience that was customizable, and really user centered. It created an amazing product with a very good focus on the design of not just the hardware, but the software that allows you to manage what you want to play.

  <p> Prototyping is a process in which a non-functional model of the product is created. This prototype doesn’t include all aspects of the final design, but it can go over the main functionalities of it. We prototype to test out different options for the design of the software, and to demonstrate what the software is trying to accomplish. 
</p>
  <p> Prototyping is very important in software design because it gives an overall representation of the software and its key features before developing the product into its final form. It helps us validate the requirements that we outlined earlier as well as explore alternate solutions to satisfying those requirements. Above all, it helps us see how users interact with the software, and users can give feedback through the use of prototyping.</p>
  <p> The benefits of prototyping is that it can improve the usability of the software, after going through multiple rounds of feedback to really make the most easy to use software for the user. This can also lead to improvements to the overall design quality of the software. One of the most key benefits though is that it considers real user needs because of their involvement in the process. Their interaction and feedback is very important.</p>
  <p> One type of prototype is a paper prototype. This is a simple prototype designed with paper, pens, sticky notes, markers, and other items. It’s a simple way to brainstorm and test user interfaces. The 4 steps are choosing the most important user, determining typical tasks, making screenshots or sketches, and then performing a usability test. Paper prototypes should be low fidelity, but it requires lots of interaction with the user. During the test, people should be observing how the user interacts with the software, and there should also be someone very familiar with the prototype.</p>

  <h1>Writing Assignment 6</h1>
  <p> Communication is an extremely important part of software design because it involves clearly stating ideas and thoughts through all the different stages of software design. We often talk to other software developers, as well as clients and users. In the requirements stage, it involves talking with the client about what they want solved, and then putting these ideas down in the requirements document in a clear way for your team to understand. In the design stage, it involves talking with team members to solve the problem, to fix any issues that arise, and to understand what each person is doing. It’s essential to figuring out problems in all stages of software design and how they can be fixed.</p>
  <p> Three main elements that are key to effective communication are active listening, being clear and concise, and giving feedback. Active listening ensures that you are actually listening to what the person is saying, and understanding the information that they are giving you. This means asking questions when you don’t understand what they are saying. Then comes being clear and concise. It’s absolutely vital when you’re on the talking side of communication. You need to relay information in a way that the other group will actually understand what you’re saying. Then comes feedback, where you honestly give the other party genuine feedback that can help them improve. This helps fix issues that may be encountered.</p>
  <p> A communication issue I encountered was with my old driving instructor. He had a strong accent and I didn’t understand him the best. I failed to ask questions because I thought I would annoy him, but this led to me messing up on the road and not doing what he asked. Now I know I should’ve asked him to clarify, before I acted without knowing what he said.</p>


  <h1> Writing Assignment 7 </h1>
  <p> The design principle that was most interesting to me that I'd like to work on in the design assignment is accessibility. There’s so many aspects that go into nailing accessibility, but the key purpose of accessibility is to design things so that they can be used by the most amount of people possible. It’s a principle that’s made up of perceptibility, operability, simplicity, and forgiveness. To sum those 4 factors up, they combine to try and make the software as easy to use for the user, and takes into account any problems that users might face. It’s very concerned with how the user is able to use the software, and it should be easy so everyone can use it. It’s quite important in software design for the reasons I stated above. For the software to be successful and solve the problem, it should be understandable and should consider as many users as possible. </p>
<p> I’ve encountered this principle a few times in real life. The first is on the GO Train. There are ramps that are put out for people with wheelchairs or strollers, so they can get onto the train, as well as seating areas for them. There are also audible directions for which stations are being stopped at and when the train is leaving, along with maps of the train route for those who might not be able to see or hear. The second example is when I worked at Cineplex. We had wheelchair accessible seating in our theaters, as well as closed caption devices, and enhanced audio devices for those who might need them. Both of these enhanced the user experience by giving them many options to understand what was happening in the train or theater. Both examples were able to cater to a wide audience of users.
