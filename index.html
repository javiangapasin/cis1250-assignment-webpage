  <h1>Writing Assignment 1</h1>
  <p>The software development process is the process of planning, designing, and implementing software. The point of this process is to try and develop the best solution possible to a client’s problem. It’s made up of 5 main steps. Gathering requirements about the problem, such as a timeframe or certain aspects that must be included. It focuses on WHAT the problem is. Next is designing a plan to build the software. This step requires problem solving skills, careful planning and ultimately requires the most time and effort. Doing this step well will speed up the rest of the process. This focuses on HOW the problem is solved. After this comes the implementation process, where the actual programming is done and the software is built. Next is the verification process, where test cases are run to ensure that the software is actually meeting the requirements that were gathered in the first stage, and ensuring that the software is working properly. Most importantly, this checks to make sure that the software does what the client was asking for, and makes sure that the problem is being solved the way that the client wants. Finally, after all of these steps, is maintenance. This step requires making sure the software continues to run well, checking in with the client to see if it is still performing okay, and maybe even updating the software so that it runs more optimally. 
</p>
  <p>Software design is important because it’s extremely beneficial to have software that is easy to use, but also solves whatever problem the software was designed for. You can’t just solve a problem right away and build a good piece of software like that. The process is important, and therefore the way that the software is designed is also important.</p>
  <p>For example, I use a piece of software called Notion. It helps me stay organized, so I know what needs to be done. I think it’s well designed for a few reasons. First and foremost the interface is extremely user friendly. It’s black and white, with a nice font, and it’s very easy to navigate with all its labels. The actions that you can perform are very straightforward, as it tells you what each button can do. There’s also a lot of flexibility in the actions you can perform and the things you can do, from calendars to lists. It’s also cross platform, and free to use!</p>
